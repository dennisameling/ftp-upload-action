# Simple FTP upload

With this Action, you can upload folder contents to an FTP server. **Overwrites existing files on the server!**

This Action uploads files straight to the FTP server, without keeping a sync state. If you need a sync state, consider using [SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ftp-deploy) instead.

Tested and works on:
- `ubuntu-latest`
- `windows-latest`
- `macos-latest`

## Basic usage

```YAML
  uses: dennisameling/ftp-upload-action@v1
  with:
    server: ${{ secrets.FTP_SERVER }}
    username: ${{ secrets.FTP_USER }}
    password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
    local_dir: ./ # Should always end with /
    server_dir: ./ # Should always end with /
```
